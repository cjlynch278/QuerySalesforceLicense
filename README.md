# QuerySalesforceLicense
Simply download the three files ("QueryLicenses.py", "Runnable.py", and "Credentials.txt") and run the "Runnable.py" file to start the program.

NOTE: In order for this program to work, you need to edit the "Credentials.txt" and enter a username, password, security token for a salesforce org.  
The format of the credential file should follow the example with a forward slash in between each credential i.e. username/password/securitytoken
